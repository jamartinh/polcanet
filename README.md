# POLCANet: Principal Latent Components Analysis Autoencoder

## Overview

POLCANet is an advanced autoencoder model designed to generate orthogonal features, concentrate variance in the first components, enforce an exponential variance concentration distribution, and ensure that latent components adhere to linear function definitions (additivity and homogeneity). This repository contains the POLCANet model implementation along with functions for comprehensive analysis and reporting.

## Key Properties

POLCANet aims to achieve the following key properties:

1. **Generate Orthogonal Features:** Minimize the cosine distance between latent features.
2. **Concentrate Variance in the First Components:** Minimize the center of mass of the latent space with respect to the left side.
3. **Enforce Exponential Variance Concentration:** Ensure the variance concentration distribution follows an exponential decay.
4. **Guarantee Linear Function Definitions:** Ensure the latent components satisfy additivity (f(x + y) = f(x) + f(y)) and homogeneity (a.f(x) = f(a.x)).

## Analysis Functions

### 1. Orthogonality Test Analysis

This report analyzes the orthogonality of the latent features generated by the autoencoder. We used a sample size of 100 randomly selected data points for the analysis.

The orthogonality of the features is assessed by minimizing the cosine distance between the latent features. The cosine similarity values between the features are summarized below:

- Mean cosine similarity: 0.0000
- Max cosine similarity: 0.0000
- Min cosine similarity: 0.0000

### 2. Variance Test Analysis

This report analyzes the variance concentration of the latent features generated by the autoencoder. We used a sample size of 100 randomly selected data points for the analysis.

The variance concentration of the features is assessed by minimizing the center of mass of the latent space and fitting the variance distribution to an exponential distribution. The results are summarized below:

- Center of mass: 0.0000
- Variance fit to exponential distribution (sum of squared differences): 0.0000

### 3. Linearity Tests Analysis

This report analyzes the linearity properties of the autoencoder. We used a sample size of 100 randomly selected data points for the analysis.

The linearity properties of the features are assessed through two tests: additive property and homogeneity property. The results are summarized below:

#### Additive Property

The additive property is tested to verify if:

f(z(x) + z(y)) = f(z(x)) + f(z(y))

The differences between the left-hand side and the right-hand side of the equation are summarized below:

- Mean difference: 0.0000
- Max difference: 0.0000
- Min difference: 0.0000

#### Homogeneity Property (Scalar alpha)

The homogeneity property is tested to verify if:

f(\alpha z(x)) = \alpha f(z(x))

The differences between the left-hand side and the right-hand side of the equation are summarized below:

- Mean difference: 0.0000
- Max difference: 0.0000
- Min difference: 0.0000
